# Hello-World
resources, ideas, or space for discussion


I am Anthony! I am a med student that is set back by a pandemic... I am losing the fight before even getting started. So I decided to learn something new to continue moving forward and now I am here. 
I have many endeavors which I desire to pursue. I would like to make websites, mobile games, and eventually my own firewall if that is possible.
I am still rather new to this so if I don't make too much sense do not pay any attention. I am excited and look forward to bettering myself in this field.
